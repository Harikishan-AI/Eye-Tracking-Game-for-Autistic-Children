Eye Tracking Games for Autistic Children
Objective
The project involves the development of two interactive games aimed at improving the cognitive abilities of autistic children through eye-tracking technology. These games are designed to measure and enhance attention, concentration, and reaction time, offering a unique, non-invasive way to monitor the child's progress over time.

Game 1: Stopwatch
The first game is a Stopwatch game where the child’s reaction time is tested. After registering with a username, the child can log in and control the game using their eyes. The challenge is to start and stop the game within a very short timeframe. By analyzing the reaction time through plotted charts, we can determine the child’s improvement. If the reaction time decreases consistently, it indicates improvement, and medication may not be necessary. If not, medical intervention might be required.

Game 2: Coin Collection (Under Development)
The second game, Coin Collection, is still in the development stage. In this game, the child uses eye movements to collect coins, with engaging graphics designed to capture and maintain the child's interest. Once all the coins are collected, the score is displayed and stored in a MongoDB database. The stored data is then visualized through graphs, allowing for detailed analysis of the child’s performance.

Data Analysis and Visualization
All the data collected during gameplay, including reaction times and scores, are stored in a MongoDB database. This data is then plotted in graphs to visualize the child's progress over time. Doctors can use these graphs to monitor whether the child is consistently playing the game, and to assess the need for any further treatment or intervention. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the game in improving the child’s cognitive abilities.

Future Goals
Expansion of Game Portfolio: We aim to develop additional games that are both attractive and engaging for children, further enhancing their focus and concentration.
Voice Command Integration: Future versions of the games will include voice command features, allowing children to interact with the game using voice control for typing or movement.
Unified App Development: We plan to integrate all games into a single unified application or tool, making it accessible to a broader audience. Monetization strategies will be explored to bring this tool to the global market.
Comprehensive Care
While these eye-tracking games can be a valuable tool for improving attention and concentration in autistic children, they should be part of a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan. It’s important to tailor the games to the specific needs and preferences of each child, as autistic children have varying sensory and cognitive profiles. Involving parents, caregivers, and professionals in the design process ensures that the game is both appropriate and effective for the child’s unique needs.
